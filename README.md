### What I learned

I took this opportunity to create all the icons on my own. I have understood the purpose of different tags used while creating the icons

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development/improvements

if i were to create a line diagram for left arrow and right arrow, I will use stroke-linejoin=”round”
